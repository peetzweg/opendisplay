# OpenDisplay

**Turn your spare Apple devices into second monitors for your Mac — free, open source, no subscription.**

iPhone and iPad today, spare MacBooks on the roadmap. A self-hosted
alternative to Apple Sidecar, Duet Display, and Luna Display: true extended
display (not just mirroring), Retina-sharp, over USB or WiFi, with touch and
scroll input.

## Why OpenDisplay exists

Turning an iPhone or iPad into an external display for a Mac is a solved
problem — but every existing option has a catch:

- **Apple Sidecar** is free but requires both devices on the *same Apple ID*,
  doesn't support iPhones at all, and only works on supported hardware pairs.
- **Duet Display** moved to a subscription.
- **Luna Display** requires a hardware dongle.

OpenDisplay is the missing option: a **free, open-source, no-account,
no-dongle** way to use the iOS device you already own as a true second
display. If you were about to write your own — don't! Contribute here
instead; the hard parts (virtual display creation, low-latency H.264
pipeline, USB transport, input injection) are already working.

## Features

- 🖥️ **True display extension** — macOS treats the device as a real second
  monitor (drag windows to it, arrange it in System Settings), not a mirror.
  Mirroring is also available as a mode.
- 🔌 **USB-wired for lowest latency** — streams over the Lightning/USB-C
  cable via macOS's built-in `usbmuxd`; plug in and go, no network, no
  WiFi jitter, no helper tools.
- 📶 **WiFi with zero config** — the iPhone advertises itself via Bonjour;
  pick it from a dropdown on the Mac.
- 🔍 **Retina / HiDPI** — the virtual display matches the device panel
  pixel-for-pixel (@2x), so text is sharp.
- 👆 **Touch input built in** — your iPhone becomes a touchscreen for macOS:
  **tap to click**, **drag to drag**, and **two-finger scroll** that feels
  like a trackpad. (Apple Pencil support is on the roadmap.)
- 🔄 **Portrait or landscape** — rotate the device and the virtual display
  rebuilds itself as a vertical monitor at native resolution.
- ⚡ **Low-latency pipeline** — hardware H.264 encode (VideoToolbox,
  real-time mode, no B-frames), TCP_NODELAY, frame-drop backpressure with
  keyframe recovery, decode-and-render via `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`.
- 🔒 **Self-hosted & private** — your screen never touches anyone's server.
  Two small apps, one TCP connection, that's it.

## How it works

```
MAC (sender)                                      iPHONE / iPAD (receiver)
CGVirtualDisplay  ← macOS believes a monitor is attached
   → ScreenCaptureKit (capture the virtual display)
   → VideoToolbox H.264 (hardware, real-time)
   → TCP  [4-byte length][Annex B frame]  ═══════→  NWListener :9000
                                                      → AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer
   ← JSON control messages (hello, touch, scroll) ═══
   → CGEvent injection (click / drag / scroll)
```

The **phone listens and the Mac connects** — that ordering is what makes the
exact same code work over USB (via the `usbmuxd` daemon built into every
macOS install) and WiFi. The phone
announces its native panel size; the Mac creates a `CGVirtualDisplay` at
exactly half that in points (@2x HiDPI) and streams the pixels back.

`CGVirtualDisplay` is a **private CoreGraphics API** (the same one used by
BetterDisplay and DeskPad) — which is precisely why this project can't ship
on the App Store and lives on GitHub instead.

## Install

You need **two apps**: a Mac app (captures and sends) and an iOS app
(receives and displays).

### Prebuilt downloads (Mac)

Grab `OpenDisplay.dmg` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/peetzweg/opendisplay/releases/latest).
The app is signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple, so it
opens with a plain double-click on macOS 14+ — no Gatekeeper warning. Open the
`.dmg` and drag the app to Applications.

### iPhone app

- **TestFlight** (recommended): join the public beta at
  [testflight.apple.com/join/3NYaY11c](https://testflight.apple.com/join/3NYaY11c).
- **Build from source**: open the project in Xcode, select your free Apple ID
  under Signing, hit Run. Takes ~2 minutes.

## Quick start (from source)

### Prerequisites

```sh
brew install xcodegen   # project generation
```

Xcode 15+ and a free or paid Apple developer account (to sideload the iOS
app onto your device).

### Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/peetzweg/opendisplay.git
cd opendisplay
echo "DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOURTEAMID" > .env   # your Apple team ID, for signing
./generate.sh                               # runs xcodegen with your .env
xcodebuild -project OpenSidecar.xcodeproj -scheme OpenSidecarMac \
  -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build build
xcodebuild -project OpenSidecar.xcodeproj -scheme OpenSidecariOS \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -derivedDataPath build -allowProvisioningUpdates build
```

(Or open `OpenSidecar.xcodeproj` in Xcode and hit Run on each target. Your
team ID is shown at [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account)
under Membership, or just pick your team in Xcode's Signing pane.)

### Run (USB — recommended)

1. Install + open **OpenDisplay** on the iPhone (it listens on port 9000).
2. On the Mac, run `./run.sh` (or just open the app) — it talks to macOS's
   built-in `usbmuxd` directly and auto-connects over the cable. No tunnel
   tools needed.
3. Grant **Screen Recording** (for capture) and **Accessibility** (for touch)
   when macOS asks — one time each.
4. Drag a window onto your new display. Done.

### Run (WiFi)

Open the iPhone app, then pick **"iPhone (WiFi)"** from the Connection menu
in the Mac app. Discovery is automatic via Bonjour. USB has lower latency;
WiFi has no cable.

### Permissions checklist

macOS and iOS gate several things this app needs — most prompt on first use,
but some **fail silently** if denied or missed. The Mac app shows a live
permission status panel; the iPhone app has a settings screen (shake the
phone, or tap Settings & Help when idle).

| Where | Permission | Needed for | If missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mac | Screen Recording | capturing the display | black screen on the phone |
| Mac | Accessibility | touch/scroll input | taps do nothing |
| Mac | **Local Network** | WiFi discovery | no device in the Connection menu |
| iPhone | **Local Network** | WiFi discovery | Mac can't find the phone |

All live under **Privacy & Security** in System Settings (Mac) / Settings
(iPhone). The Local Network ones are only needed for WiFi mode — USB works
without them. If the prompt never appeared, toggle the entry manually or
force-quit and reopen the app.

## FAQ

**Why do I see the purple screen-recording indicator in the menu bar?**
That's a macOS privacy indicator shown for *any* app that captures the
screen — Duet, Luna, OBS, and Zoom trigger it too. Apple Sidecar doesn't,
only because it's implemented inside the OS rather than on public capture
APIs. It cannot (and shouldn't) be hidden by an app; it's how macOS tells
you a capture is running.

**The Mac app doesn't show my iPhone in the Connection menu (WiFi).**
Both sides need **Local Network** permission, and both fail *silently*
without it: check Privacy & Security → Local Network on the Mac **and** on
the iPhone, make sure both are on the same WiFi network, and keep the
iPhone app open in the foreground. USB mode is unaffected.

**Does it support iPad?** The receiver app is universal (iPhone + iPad);
iPad is the same codebase. iPad-specific polish (Pencil, pressure) is on the
roadmap.

**Why H.264 and not HEVC/AV1?** Hardware H.264 encode/decode is universally
fast and the latency is excellent. HEVC is a planned option for better
quality-per-bit.

**Is my screen content sent anywhere?** No. One direct TCP connection
between your Mac and your device, over your cable or your LAN. No servers,
no accounts, no analytics. Full details — including what the apps store
locally and the current WiFi-encryption caveat — on the
[privacy page](https://peetzweg.github.io/opendisplay/privacy.html).

**What's the license? Can I fork it or use it commercially?**
[GPL-3.0](LICENSE). Use, study, and adapt it freely — commercially too. If
you distribute a modified version it must stay open source under the same
license with the original attribution intact, so improvements flow back
instead of into closed forks. (Releases up to v0.4.x were MIT-licensed and
remain available under those terms.)

**Will it break on a macOS update?** Possibly — `CGVirtualDisplay` is
private API. The same risk applies to every virtual-display product.
The capture/streaming pipeline itself uses only public APIs.

**Audio?** Out of scope for now.

## Auto-update (macOS app)

The macOS app updates itself with [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) —
an open-source framework, **not** a hosted service. Update checks hit only
our own infrastructure:

- The app reads an **appcast** feed hosted on the landing-page site:
  `https://opendisplay.app/appcast.xml` (`SUFeedURL` in `project.yml`).
- The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, `build-mac` job)
  runs Sparkle's `generate_appcast` against the notarized `OpenDisplay.dmg`,
  signs it with the EdDSA key, commits the result to `public/appcast.xml`,
  and dispatches the Pages deploy — so the published feed points download
  links at the GitHub Release assets.
- Sparkle verifies both the EdDSA signature and Apple's notarization before
  installing. The app checks automatically in the background
  (`SUEnableAutomaticChecks`) and offers a manual **"Check for Updates…"**
  button next to **Quit** in the menu-bar window.

### Maintainer prerequisites (before auto-update goes live)

Auto-update is **scaffolded but inert** until the signing keys are in place.
The private signing key is **never** committed — it lives only as a CI
secret. To switch it on:

1. **Generate the key pair.** Run Sparkle's `generate_keys` once (it ships
   in the Sparkle SPM artifact bundle and in the release tarball at
   `bin/generate_keys`). It prints a **public** key and stores the
   **private** key in your login keychain.
2. **Public key →** paste it into `SUPublicEDKey` in `project.yml` (replace
   the `REPLACE_WITH_SUPUBLICEDKEY_FROM_generate_keys` placeholder), then
   re-run `xcodegen generate` and commit.
3. **Private key →** add it as the `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub Actions
   secret (export it with `generate_keys -x private_key.pem` if needed). The
   appcast step in `release.yml` no-ops gracefully while this secret is
   absent, so releases keep working until you're ready.
4. The **first appcast publishes on the next release** after both keys are
   set. Confirm `https://opendisplay.app/appcast.xml` resolves, then **test
   the full update flow on a real signed/notarized build** (check → download
   → verify → relaunch) — this can't be validated in CI.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are very welcome — especially for the roadmap items above.
The codebase is intentionally small: ~4 Swift files per platform, with
[Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) (SPM) as the macOS app's only
runtime dependency, for auto-update. The [How it works](#how-it-works)
section above is the architecture doc; see `Mac/CGVirtualDisplayPrivate.h`
for the private API surface.

Releases are automated with
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please): use
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) (`feat:`,
`fix:`, `docs:`, …) and a release PR with a generated changelog appears
automatically — merging it tags the release and attaches prebuilt
artifacts.
